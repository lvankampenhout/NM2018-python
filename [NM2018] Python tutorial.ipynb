    "Awesome, we only need 1 line of code, instead of three. For now, we recommend that you use this interactive interface, because its simpler to use. Using `pyplot` means that all plotting command starts with `plt.xx`. Just remember that this way of plotting is less flexible, because the axes are not named and cannot be re-used or modified by functions. To learn more about the anatomy of a figure, and the different styles of plotting, see the [Matplotlib FAQ](matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html)."

    "**Exercise (Lineplots).** Lineplots or $xy$−plots are the most simple kind of plot. First, the domain $[0,2\\pi]$ is \"discretized\" or divided into segments. We’ll start off with a rather coarse discretization:\n",
    "$$x = [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2] \\pi$$\n",
    "1. Create an ndarray named x containing these values.\n",
    "2. Calculate $y_1 = sin(x)$ and plot the result using `plt.plot(x,y1,’-s’)`. Explain whether you are happy with the discretization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The squares in the figure you just produced are called _vertices_. Mathematically speaking, the vertices are a discrete set ${x_0,x_1,...,x_N}$ at which the function $y$ is evaluated. The `s` in the plotting command stands for ’square’ which is the marker type drawn at every vertex. The `-` stands for ’solid line’ which connects the vertices using straight line segments.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Increasing the resolution of x (the spacing of vertices) can be done by hand, which is cumbersome and prone to errors. Instead, use a list comprehension to generate the vertices, ideally converting them into an ndarray afterwards. Alternatively, use `np.linspace()`. Discretize the same domain, but now with 10 vertices (`np.size(x) = 10`) and remake the sine-plot. Verify that there are 9 segments in the graph. Why 9?\n",
    "4. Remake the plot with 100 vertices. Drop the ’s’ in the plot command to get rid of the markers. How many line segments are there now?\n",
    "5. In the same plot, draw $y_2 = cos(x)$. Then make the following additions:\n",
    "    * put axis labels\n",
